    > pairs
    A dictionary that contains the custom types you want to support (key), and the callables used for converting each custom type to bytes (value). Like so: `{type: callable}`.
    When `type` is found during serialization, `callable` will be invoked, passing the object of said type as argument.
    The callable should return a tuple with the ID (int, -128 to 127) to later identify the type with later on index 0,
    and a bytes object containing the data to be stored on index 1, like so: `return id, my_data`.

class ExtTypesDecode:
    """
    Class for using ext types for decoding data.
    
    > Returns
    Object that can be passed along to `decode` methods.
    
    > pairs
    A dictionary that contains the ID that was used for encoding the type during encoding (key), and a callable used for converting the stored data back into an object. Like so: `{ID: callable}`.
    When an ext type is found, the ID stored alongside it is used to decide what callable to invoke. If our `pairs` was `{1: abc, 2: def}` and we find an ext type with ID 1, `abc` will be called.
    The callable will receive a bytes object (by default) that contains the bytes that were received alongside the ID during serialization.
    
    > arg_type
    The datatype a callable will receive when ext data is passed to a callable from `pairs`.
    This defaults to bytes but can be set to `memoryview`, which is better in terms of performance, but may be more limiting.
