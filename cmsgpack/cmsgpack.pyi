        When `type` is found during serialization, `callable` will be invoked, passing the object of said type as argument.
        
        The callable should return a tuple with the ID (int, -128 to 127) to later identify the type with later on index 0, and a bytes object containing the data to be stored on index 1, like so: `return id, my_data`.

        A dictionary that contains the ID that was used for encoding the type during encoding (key), and a callable used for converting the stored data back into an object. Like so: `{ID: callable}`.
        
        When an ext type is found, the ID stored alongside it is used to decide what callable to invoke. If our `pairs` was `{1: abc, 2: def}` and we find an ext type with ID 1, `abc` will be called.
        
        The callable will receive a bytes object (by default) that contains the bytes that were received alongside the ID during serialization.
        
        
        argtype:
        The datatype a callable will receive when ext data is passed to a callable from `pairs`. This defaults to bytes but can be set to `memoryview`, which is better in terms of performance, but may be more limiting.
